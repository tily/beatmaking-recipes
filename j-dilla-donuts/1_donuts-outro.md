        * "Dilla isolated the strings from the sample by micro-looping the little string stab at 0:16 and then cutting the baseline out using a hi pass filter. Pretty ingenious sampling."

    > Hi There  
    > well I've pretty much managed to isolate the strings from the shuggie otis sample. They don't sound exactly the same but I'm hoping they will when they sit within the whole mix.  
    > What I did to isolate the sample was this:  
    > First I sampled from vinyl into the MPC Pitching it down a little. I then chopped it all till i found that at second 16 (for only one second) was when the string was almost isolated (except the bass was still with it). I used a lo cut up to 620hz. I then loaded the sample in Reason's NNXT sampler. I changed the start of the sample to 25%. Made it be played in Back and Forward Loop Mode with loop start 25% and loop end 75% thus locking the oscillation of the loop to the tempo of the song. 96.5bpm  
    > I then used the central cancelation technique on the sample to try to remove as much as i could.  
    > I haven't added any reverb, Eq or compression yet. I'm waiting to see how it all goes when i start building the rest of the track.  
    > I've attached the audio file with the string sample. Try playing it to a 96.5bpm. 5bars.  
    > Any Suggestions, comments, etc.. are more than welcome.  
    > PD: It ain't finished yet. I'm thinking about relayering it after to get that flangy metalic sound on the strings... we'll see.
